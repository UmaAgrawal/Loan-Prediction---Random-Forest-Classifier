# Loan Prediction with Random Forest Classifier

## Overview

This project aims to predict loan approval or rejection using a Random Forest classifier. The model is trained on historical data to make predictions on future loan applications. The goal is to assist financial institutions in automating their loan approval process and improving decision-making.



## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is provided in the `data` directory. It includes features such as applicant information, credit history, loan amount, and loan approval status. You can find the dataset [here]
